## Introduction

I often play darts with my family, and we used apps to keep tracks of our points. But in these apps, you have to manually enter the points you made during your turn. I always thought to myself "wouldn't it be cooler if we clicked where we thrown the dart on the target". And this is what this project is.

## How to play 

At the top of the screen, choose the number of players and click "New Game". Click on up to three spots on the target, then click on "Next turn" at the bottom of the screen to register the points, then the next players register theirs points.
